# Educational Budgets Data Analysis
I wanted to share this project I did for a class because I am very proud of it and I was able to analyze something that I found interesting: a potential link between k-8 success rates and government educational expenditures.

As this was a project intended for people beginning data science, there were some limitations as to what we could do and the data itself. The analysis is very simple in terms of mathematical concepts (correlation, linear regression, etc.). The data used was limited since not all countries reported their k-8 graduation rates, government educational budgets, and some did not report both. So the data was very limited to the countries that did have both variables.

Further Exploration: In the future, I would like to expand this analysis and even applying the knowledge gained from this project by developing some type of predictive tool where one can input the budget alloted to education (and the total budget) and the tool can predict a countries' education success rate (if there were to be a strong connection). 

Although this was a simple (and effective) data analysis project, I learned a lot and I hope to do more insightful and fun projects in the future!
